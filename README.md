# Azul-in-Python

I was playing the board game Azul tonight, and thought it would be a fun game to recreate in Python.
I'm hoping to learn more about making GUIs in Python through this project, as well as brush up on some python basics I've let get rusty.
The end goal is to be able to play this game with friends without needing the board, controling it with phones, and maybe displaying tiles on the TV.
